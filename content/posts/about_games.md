so I finally got a switch I got it this last holiday season and started with a few games: animal crossing: new horizons, the legend of Zelda: breath of the wild, 
Mario kart 8 deluxe.  and man I thought I would be addicted to breath of the wild 
and I was wrong I barely play it instead I play animal crossing: new horizons every day 
and really good to customize the whole island sometimes it's annoying to collect fruits and stuff but overall it's really relaxing
