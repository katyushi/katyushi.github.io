1. I'm not going to be super precise here on this post 
2. a shot of espresso is somewhere between 35ml to 40ml my machine default is 50ml 

so I recently got a "little" capsule espresso machine it's kinda fun to thinker around to see what it can do,
so here are some recipes for simple espresso drinks and desserts 

## 1. Affogato
an affogato is a simple dessert, you'll need:
* a shot of espresso
* 1 scoop of ice cream (or 2 idk adjust to taste)

just put the ice cream in a cup and put the shot of espresso on top and eat.

## 2. Espresso with tonic
it may seen to not taste good but its really pleasant to drink on a hot summer day, you'll need:
* a shot of espresso 
* tonic water
* ice (not really needed)

add some ice on the cup then add the tonic then just put the shot of espresso on top if you want add some sugar and enjoy.

## 3. Americano
it's a shot of espresso diluted that's it, you'll need:
* a shot of espresso 
* water

add some water to the cup put the shot of espresso on top
